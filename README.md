Introduction
This simulator was made using python, having an interface in Java. It was made in order to simulate the ideal geometry of a rocket nozzle. It allows the user to:

- Plot the geometry profile in a 2D graphic and have a pre-view of the geometry in a 3D plot;
- Calculate the ideal throat radius;
- Plotting ideal expansion ratio to maximize thrust for various chamber pressures;
- Plotting performance parameters ( Specific Impulse, Thrust, Mach, etc) for various O/F relations;
- Plotting exhaust parameters (exhaust temperature and velocity) for different chamber pressures;
- In the 2D plot, the contraction ratio, parabola exit angle and nozzle length are given in the graphic;
